# Toronto Clustering

This project focuses on clustering a part of Toronto by analyzing the types of venues present within a postal code region. The purpose of this project was to learn and practice with the following libraries, packages, and APIs: BeautifulSoup, Scikit-Learn, YellowBrick, Foursquare, and Folium. This project was created during my progress in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate track and references the IBM Manhattan Clustering lab.


For a complete description and code, please take a look at the notebook file. As GitHub does not properly display Folium maps, to view the file with all of its components, use the following link to view the [notebook file](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tlwang179/toronto_clustering/blob/master/WebScraping_Segmenting_Clustering_Neighborhoods.ipynb).
